            <p>I have been brewing beer for 10 years, and enjoy experimenting with various styles and flavors. I got started brewing Belgian beers, 
                but I've branched out to IPAs, stouts, and many other styles.

                <p>I enjoy using microcontrollers to accomplish various tasks, from my Arduino controlled 240 volt homebrewing system
                    to my Raspberry Pi web server. I also enjoy making web applications like the one you are viewing now!

                        are hilarious.
